CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_base_xc7a_i_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): ALPIDE_reader/clk_100MHz, Inst_system_clocks/sysclk_p, clk_base_xc7a_i_IBUF_inst/O
Related violations: <none>
