TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch ALPIDE_reader/pin_in_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin ALPIDE_reader/pin_in_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-24#1 Warning
Overridden Max delay datapath only  
A set_clock_groups or a set_false path (see constraint position 11 in the Timing Constraints window in Vivado IDE) between clocks clk_rx and clk_tx_mac overrides a set_max_delay -datapath_only (position 3). It is not recommended to override a set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint. Replace the set_clock_groups or set_false_path between clocks with point-to-point set_false_path constraints
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-24#2 Warning
Overridden Max delay datapath only  
A set_clock_groups or a set_false path (see constraint position 11 in the Timing Constraints window in Vivado IDE) between clocks clk_rx and clk_tx_mac overrides a set_max_delay -datapath_only (position 4). It is not recommended to override a set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint. Replace the set_clock_groups or set_false_path between clocks with point-to-point set_false_path constraints
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-24#3 Warning
Overridden Max delay datapath only  
A set_clock_groups or a set_false path (see constraint position 11 in the Timing Constraints window in Vivado IDE) between clocks clk_rx and clk_tx_mac overrides a set_max_delay -datapath_only (position 5). It is not recommended to override a set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint. Replace the set_clock_groups or set_false_path between clocks with point-to-point set_false_path constraints
Related violations: <none>
